# What's this?

Early-stage development and prototyping of the HTML5 UI for Curator, the web install 
toolkit.

This project is built on Zurb's [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps.html),
which in turn is built on AngularJS. It should be runnable using the standard [Getting
Started](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/getting-started.html) procedure for Foundation
for Apps: install the things, then npm start.

The major components of the curator-wik project will likely be licensed under the GNU
GPLv2, but license selection is ongoing. Make no licensing assumptions about this work
until further notice.
