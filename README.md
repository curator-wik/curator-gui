# What's this?

Early-stage development and prototyping of the HTML5 UI for Curator, the web install 
toolkit.

This project is built on Zurb's [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps.html),
which in turn is built on AngularJS. It should be runnable by:
  - installing all the things listed on Foundation for Apps'
    [Getting Started](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/getting-started.html)
    page
  - Running npm install in the repository root
  - Running bower install in the repository root
Then npm start.

The major components of the curator-wik project will likely be licensed under the GNU
GPLv2, but license selection is ongoing. Make no licensing assumptions about this work
until further notice.
